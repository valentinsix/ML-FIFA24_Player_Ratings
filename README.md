# ML-FIFA24_Player_Ratings

## Calculating EA Sports FC 24 Player Ratings based on their Stats :
Ever since I was a kid, I have always played the FIFA games on my computer or PS4. In the FIFA games, each player has an "Overall Rating": it is a number that represents how "good" he is in the game. Each player also has many other ratings that give us an idea of the strengths of a certain player. But how are those Overall "Ratings" calculated ? That was always an intereting question for me.  
In this project, the aim is to see if we can predict accurately player's overall ratings. We will use different methods :

First method: the "Overall Rating" will be calculated as a linear combination of all his ratings  
Second method: we will try to predict a player's "Overall Rating" with IRL statistics of the players for the previous season (not sure if this is possible, but we will give it a go !)
